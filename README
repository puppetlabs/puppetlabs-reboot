reboot
======

Overview
--------

The reboot module provides a type and provider for managing system reboots with Puppet. Currently, there is only a provider for Windows.

Usage
-----

A common scenario is to install a package, and then perform a reboot to complete installation:

    package { 'Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5':
      ensure          => installed,
      source          => '\\server\share\dotnetfx45_full_x86_x64.exe',
      install_options => ['/Passive', '/NoRestart'],
      provider        => windows,
    }
    reboot { 'after':
      subscribe       => Package['Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5'],
    }

The reboot resource subscribes to the package resource, so if the package is installed, then the reboot will automatically be performed. If the package is not installed, then no reboot will take place.

The reboot resource can also check if the system is in a reboot pending state, and if so, reboot the system prior to performing other actions. For example, some Windows packages will not install, while a reboot is pending. This can be modeled as:

    reboot { 'before':
      when            => pending,
    }
    package { 'Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5':
      ensure          => installed,
      source          => '\\server\share\dotnetfx45_full_x86_x64.exe',
      install_options => ['/Passive', '/NoRestart'],
      provider        => windows,
      require         => Reboot['before'],
    }
    
If a reboot is pending, then puppet will reboot the system before installing the package.
